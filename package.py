    pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification
    capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath
    1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode
    interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen automatically during
    parsing/saving).
